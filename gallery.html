<h1>My latest artwork</h1>
<img src="images/HusseinSenhoob_selfie_600px.jpg" alt="my selfie project" width="400px"/>
<p>This project represents a selfie of myself and people that are close to me and all sorts of things that generally represent me. The software I used for this project is Photoshop. The images that were used in the project are all things that are very important to me and I can't live without. The most challenging part of the project was trying to figure out how to select the background image, which I resolved by watching the recordings of the class and following the professor's instruction. There are a total of seven images, including a selfie of myself, my home country, my favorite snack, me and my big brother, me and my little brother, my cat, my best friend.

    <h1>My Vector image</h1>
    <img src="images/Hussein-Senhoob_vector_600px.png" alt="my personal avatar project" width="400px"/>
    <p>This project represents an avatar of my face. I chose the colors that are almost close to accurately resembling my face and my source of inspiration was a selfie of myself which I used to trace my own face. The most challenging part of the project was trying to draw my hair, which I later resolved by using the curvature point tool. All the shapes and images used in this project were done by me. I used the AI  software.</p>

    <p> In this project I used the software Audacity to Create an Audio Portrait of a situation using sounds. The story I decided to depict in this project was a speeding car getting into a car crash, and I combined a total of seven audio samples and used a reverb effect on one of the audio samples, which was the car alarm audio. The seven audio samples I used consist of a door opening and closing out of a house, footsteps, birds singing in nature, car door opening and car starting, car speeding, car crash and a car alarm. The most challenging part of the project was combining all the sounds together and trying to depict a clear situation due to not having the sounds I precisely needed, which I then solved by cutting the sounds and mixing and matching them to present a clear story.
