<h1>My latest artwork</h1>
<img src="images/HusseinSenhoob_selfie_600px.jpg" alt="my selfie project" width="400px"/>
<p>This project represents a selfie of myself and people that are close to me and all sorts of things that generally represent me. The software I used for this project is Photoshop. The images that were used in the project are all things that are very important to me and I can't live without. The most challenging part of the project was trying to figure out how to select the background image, which I resolved by watching the recordings of the class and following the professor's instruction. There are a total of seven images, including a selfie of myself, my home country, my favorite snack, me and my big brother, me and my little brother, my cat, my best friend.

    <h1>My Vector image</h1>
    <img src="images/Hussein-Senhoob_vector_600px.png" alt="my personal avatar project" width="400px"/>
    <p>This project represents an avatar of my face. I chose the colors that are almost close to accurately resembling my face and my source of inspiration was a selfie of myself which I used to trace my own face. The most challenging part of the project was trying to draw my hair, which I later resolved by using the curvature point tool. All the shapes and images used in this project were done by me. I used the AI  software.</p>

   <h1>My p5Js sketch</h1>
    <div><iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/husseinsenhoob/full/DHY2AexYG"width="420px" height="400px"></iframe>
    <p>In this animated p5.js sketch I created a face that has two eyes with the possibility to add a third eye by moving the mouse around. The shape of an ellipse, a circle, was chosen to look like an eye and represent the mouth and the colors represent a black, colored eye, while the third eye has an indigo eye color representing the concept of the third eye chakra. The user should interact with the program by moving the mouse around to make the third eye appear. The hardest part of this project was trying to figure out where the shapes would be placed, and I solved it by adjusting the angels multiple times to find the perfect spot.

    <p>In this 10-second animation, I expressed the emotion excitement by traveling in a car on a road going somewhere new. I used the software Adobe After Effects and the most difficult part was trying to animate the car smoothly. I tried my best, but we could go over it in class for better ways.

        <p>In this GIF animation, I used my vector image and a heavyweight cartoon image to create an animation where the heavyweight cartoon image drops onto my vector image and makes it disappear. I used the frame animation in Photoshop software and the tween technique to make it work. The most challenging part of the project was trying to make my vector image disappear after the heavyweight cartoon image crushed it by moving my vector image all the way down. However, when I did that, it appeared to mess with all the frames. I solved this issue by making my vector image invisible from the layers in the frames where the heavy heavyweight cartoon image was all the way down.</p>

    <h1>my audio project</h1>

    </audio>
    <p> In this project I used the software Audacity to Create an Audio Portrait of a situation using sounds. The story I decided to depict in this project was a speeding car getting into a car crash, and I combined a total of seven audio samples and used a reverb effect on one of the audio samples, which was the car alarm audio. The seven audio samples I used consist of a door opening and closing out of a house, footsteps, birds singing in nature, car door opening and car starting, car speeding, car crash and a car alarm. The most challenging part of the project was combining all the sounds together and trying to depict a clear situation due to not having the sounds I precisely needed, which I then solved by cutting the sounds and mixing and matching them to present a clear story.
