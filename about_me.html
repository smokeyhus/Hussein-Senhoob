    <h2>about me</h2>
<p>My name is Hussein Senhoob, and I go by the pronoun He/him. My major is animation and motion graphics. My career goals are to find a financially stable job while simultaneously being able to enjoy doing it. One of my favorite animated TV shows growing up will be Courage, the cowardly dog.I have a few hobbies, such as ice skating, playing video games, and going to the gym.
